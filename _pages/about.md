I am a Ph.D student at Zhejiang University, supervised by Prof Fei Wu. 
My current primary research focus is on speech separation and recognition tasks, 
particularly in scenarios with overlapping speech from multiple speakers, 
where I leverage multimodal information to assist in extracting the target speaker's speech content.
